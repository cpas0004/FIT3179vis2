          <p>The 2019-2020 Australia bushfires are some of the largest and most damaging bushfires ever recorded 
            in the country. The fires began unusually early in June 2019, and the season lasted until May 2020. 
            The main reason for the awfully bad fires was the dry conditions in the months leading up to them. 
            Low rainfall and drier soil allowed the fires to spread extremely quickly, according to the CSIRO 
            and the Bureau of Meteorology. The fires caused the temperature of the stratosphere above Australia 
            to rise by 3 degrees celsius. </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-6", style="height: 550px;">
        <div class="description-top-left2">
          <p>A study in 2021 using satellite data estimated that 715 million tons of CO2 was released by the fires, 
            which is almost as much as annual global air travel. 34 people lost their lives in the blaze, 9 of 
            which were firefighters. Smoke inhalation also caused a further 440 indirect deaths. 
            About 243,000 square kilometres of land was set alight, destroying entire ecosystems and killing up 
            to 3 billion terrestrial vertebrates. The geographic extent of the fires is visualised to the right, 
            as well as the 50 largest fires.</p>

          <h2>Short and Long-Term Health Impacts</h2>
          <p>During the fires, it is estimated that over 75% of Australiaâ€™s population was subject to prolonged smoke inhalation. 
            On Jan 14th 2020, the density of particulates in the air peaked at a level 14 times higher than ever before. 
            The smoke lead to over 3000 hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory problems and 1300 ER visits for asthma. 
            <br><br>
            The effects can be seen in the numbers of prescription inhaler medications dispensed peaking throughout the fires, 
            which is visualised on the left.
            According to the Menzies Institute, bushfire smoke was the cause of 440 deaths across the country in 2019-2020.

          <h2>Property Damage</h2>
          <p>Damage to property was extensive across the country. More than 3500 homes were lost across all 
            states and territories, and NSW was hit the hardest, accounting for 2400 of those destroyed homes. 
            An additional 950 homes were considered damaged but not destroyed in NSW. nationally, there were 
            over 38,000 insurance claims, and total insurance losses were around $2.3 billion. 
            Many important production facilities were set ablaze, and estimated total national property 
            damage costs were in the range of $3.65 billion.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Natural, Accidental, or Malicious?</h2>
          <p>The vast majority of bushfires are actually started by people, whether it be deliberate or accidental. 
            Accidental fires are usually caused by children according to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 
            and these are not considered malicious. Interestingly, the most common natural cause of fires is lightning.
            A large portion are marked as suspicious; these are suspected to have been lit by people but this is difficult to prove.
